# EKLAVYA Engines

EKLAVYA Engines is a powerful tool designed for business and data analysts to easily analyze and visualize data from a Multi-AI agent perspective. This project leverages multiple AI agents to streamline the data analysis process and provide insightful visualizations.

## Agents

1. **Input and Setup Agent**: Handles the initial data input and setup configurations.
2. **Data Cleaning Agent**: Cleans and preprocesses the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
3. **Data Analysis Agent**: Performs in-depth data analysis to extract meaningful insights.
4. **Data Filling Agent**: Fills in missing data points using advanced algorithms.
5. **AI Based Data Visualization Agent**: Creates visual representations of the data for easy interpretation.
6. **AI Based Query Generator**: Generates queries to extract specific information from the data.
7. **LLM Interactive Agent**: Provides an interactive interface for users to interact with the data using natural language.

## Architecture

The project uses a centralized server architecture to manage and coordinate the activities of the various agents. This ensures efficient data processing and seamless integration of the different components.
